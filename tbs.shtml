	<p align="center"><strong>To Be Saved</strong></p>
	Recognize that you are
    utterly lost as a result of the fall and the resulting original sin reckoned judicially by
    God to all the sons of Adam (the entire human race) (Rom. 5:12-15; 3:23; Psalm 51:5); that
    you are &quot;dead in trespasses and sins&quot; (Eph. 2:1) and that you are spiritually
    blind and deaf and entirely without any ability whatsoever either to move toward God on
    your own or to respond to His call without His irresistible and life-giving grace, drawing
    you mercifully to Himself (John 3:3; 9:39; 10:26-27; 12:35-36; 6:44, 65). &nbsp;
    Acknowledge that, owing to the comprehensive and corrupting taint of sin upon all the
    faculties of your nature, i.e., your intellect, affections and will (Eph. 2:1-3; 4:17-19;
    Col. 1:21), you have absolutely nothing you can claim which commends you favorably to God:
    no good works, no morality, no righteousness, that, quite the contrary, all&nbsp; your
    righteousness is as &quot;filthy rags&quot; in His sight (Isa. 64:4). &nbsp; Tremble
    before the truth that you presently languish on God's &quot;death row&quot;, a condemned
    criminal, a child of wrath and that &quot;eternal destruction away from the presence of
    the Lord&quot; is your destiny apart from a divine rescue (Rom. 3:19-20; Psalm 107:10-22; 2 Thess. 1:9).<br>
    <br>
    Realize that God has mercifully provided that rescue for His
    people through the substitutionary sacrifice of His eternal Son, Jesus Christ.&nbsp; (Isa.
    53:4-6, 8; Matt. 20:28; Mark 10:45).&nbsp; Realize that on the cross Christ was made sin
    for sinners (Isa. 53:10-12; 2 Cor. 5:21) that they might receive pardon from sin's guilt
    (Col. 1:14; 2:13; Rom. 8:1), a new gracious standing in the righteousness of Jesus Christ
    (Rom. 5:1-2; 1 Cor. 15:1) and reconciliation with His holy Father (Rom. 5:10-11; Eph.
    2:13; Col. 1:19-22).<br>
    <br>
    Repent of your sins (Mark 1:15b; Luke 24:47); turn from them
    specifically and decisively, cultivating a godly sorrow for them and a hatred of them (2
    Cor. 7:10; Psalm 32:3-5; 1 Thess. 1:9-10; Psalm 97:10).&nbsp; Be ready to make restitution
    where necessary as the Holy Spirit would lead (Luke 19:8-10).&nbsp; Repent of your
    righteousness as well as your sins, those things you thought commended you to God, but
    which you now see to be but false hopes and filthy rags (Job 15;14-16; Isa. 64:6; 28:15,
    17; Jer. 46:5).<br>
    <br>
    Receive the Lord Jesus Christ by faith and rest in His finished
    work of redemption accomplished for you at Calvary (Isa. 30:15; Matt. 11:28-29; Heb.
    4:10-11).&nbsp; Come to Christ humbly yet confidently, knowing that He is &quot;good, and
    ready to forgive, and abundant in lovingkindness to all who call upon&quot; Him (Psalm
    86:5)!&nbsp; Remember that faith does not save you, Christ saves you through faith &nbsp;
    (Eph. 2:8-9; Matt. 1:21), that gracious instrument freely bestowed upon all who have been
    &quot;appointed to eternal life&quot; (Acts 13:48).&nbsp; As such, the &quot;law of
    faith&quot; excludes all boasting in human ability, effort, privilege or worth so that we
    simply, by faith, enter into the blessing of an already accomplished redemption (Rom.
    3:27-28; John 19:30).<br>
    <br>
    And, finally, rejoice in your new standing of grace and peace
    before God (Rom. 5:1; 1 Cor. 1:3; Eph. 1:2).&nbsp; And, because of the remnants of
    indwelling sin in your soul&nbsp; (Gal. 5:17; 1 John 1:8), flee daily to the cross for its
    sin-killing and sanctifying power through a continuing and daily practice of confession
    and repentance in the power of the Holy Spirit (Zech. 13:1; 2 Cor. 10:5; Gal. 6:14; Psalm
    32:5; 1 John 1:9).<br>
