                        The members of Pilgrim Bible Church willingly subscribe to and submit themselves
                        to the following:</p>
                    <p align="center">
                        <strong>Article I: Name</strong></p>
                    <p>
                        The name of this church shall be <i>Pilgrim Bible Church</i> of Tacoma, Washington.</p>
                    <p align="center">
                        <strong>Article II: Purpose</strong></p>
                    <p>
                        Our purpose is to glorify our sovereign Lord through evangelization of the lost
                        by the faithful proclamation of the gospel of Jesus Christ from the pulpit as well
                        as from our personal witness; through the edification of the saints by the systematic,
                        expository preaching and teaching of the Scriptures and by the faithful observance
                        of the gospel ordinances of communion and baptism, so as to make known the full
                        counsel of our mighty God that we may grow up into a full knowledge of His will,
                        to please Him in all respects, to exalt His honored and awesome Name in Spirit-empowered
                        worship, and to encourage and exhort one another to grow in the grace and knowledge
                        of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.</p>
                    <p>
                        In order to fulfill this purpose, we hold to a Reformed Baptistic understanding
                        of the Scriptures. Though the 66 books of the Old and New Testaments constitute
                        the sole basis for our faith and practice, we acknowledge the two London Confessions
                        of 1644 and 1689 as generally reliable summary statements of orthodox Christian
                        belief.</p>
                    <p align="center">
                        <strong>Article III: Church Covenant</strong></p>
                    <p>
                        Having been led by God to believe in Jesus Christ as our Savior and Lord, and, having
                        followed His command in the ordinance of believer&#8217;s baptism, we do now, in
                        the presence of God and of our fellow believers, enter into covenant with one another
                        as one body in Christ.</p>
                    <p>
                        We shall, in the power of the Holy Spirit, endeavor to walk together in love; to
                        strive for the advancement of Christ&#8217;s kingdom and gospel through this church;
                        to pray for and submit to its leaders; to seek its growth in both knowledge of the
                        Word and doctrine, in holiness and in ministry; to promote its prosperity and growth
                        in grace; to sustain its worship, ordinances, discipline and doctrines and to contribute
                        faithfully and cheerfully to the financial support of the ministry, the expenses
                        of the church, the relief of the poor and the spread of the gospel throughout the
                        world (1 Pet. 1:22; Matt. 16:18-19; 28:19-20; 1 Thess. 5:12-13; Heb. 13:17; 2 Pet.
                        3:18; Titus 1:9; 1 Cor. 16:1-2; James 1:27; 2 Cor. 8:12-14).</p>
                    <p>
                        We shall endeavor to be faithful in serving this church with our time, our gifts
                        and our possessions; to maintain a sincere, exemplary and consistent walk of faith
                        before our families, our church and the world; to train our children in the doctrines
                        and duties of our faith; to maintain consistent family and private devotions; to
                        walk before all men in such humility of character and holiness of heart that our
                        proclamation of the gospel will become ever more credible, compelling and persuasive.
                        Therefore, we shall refuse to indulge in habits or practices detrimental to our
                        spiritual or physical well-being and which could compromise our gospel witness and
                        bring reproach to the name of Christ and to His church. Thus, in order to maintain
                        holiness in our walk and witness, we will refrain from casting any stumbling block
                        in the paths of others by voluntary abstention from any questionable practice, or
                        from the enjoyment of any lawful liberty which may prove offensive to the conscience
                        of a &#8220;weaker&#8221; brother (1 Tim. 1:5; 1 Pet. 4:10; Matt. 5:16; 1 Pet. 2:12;
                        Phil. 2:15; Eph. 6:4; Titus 2:10; Eph. 4:17-32; Rom. 14:12-23; 1 Cor. 8:9).</p>
                    <p>
                        We further pledge to prayerfully watch over one another in brotherly love; to aid
                        one another in sickness and in physical or financial need; to edify the Body by
                        speaking well of one another and by refusing to indulge in gossip or slander; to
                        lovingly reprove a brother or sister walking in persistent disobedience to the Lord;
                        to be slow to take offense when others have wronged us and to always maintain a
                        readiness for reconciliation (1 Pet. 4:7-10; Gal. 6:10; Rom. 12:13; Eph. 4:29; Gal.
                        6:1; James 1:19-20; Col. 3:13).</p>
                    <p>
                        We moreover covenant that, when we move from this area, we will, as soon as possible,
                        identify with a church where Christ is honored and His Word faithfully proclaimed.</p>
                    <p align="center">
                        <strong>Article IV: Membership</strong></p>
                    <p>
                        I. The Privileges of Church Membership</p>
                    <p>
                        A. <i>Spiritual protection</i>. The church is under the leadership of gifted men whose
                        oversight responsibilities include the guarding of the flock against spiritual dangers
                        from outside as well as from inside the congregation (Acts 20:28-31; Eph. 4:11-16).
                        In addition, membership binds believers together into a mutually protective covenant
                        where they pledge to pray for, edify, exhort and hold one another accountable to
                        walk in holiness before God and men (Eph. 4:1-3; 5:3-17; 6:18).</p>
                    <p>
                        B. <i>Spiritual privilege</i>. Only within the church can a believer properly express his
                        spiritual giftedness in service to the Body (Eph. 4:12; 1 Cor. 12:1-7). Only through
                        the church can the gospel mission given her by Christ be fulfilled (Acts 1:8; 8:1,
                        4) as believers are taught and equipped by the church and sent to the lost (Acts
                        13:1-3).</p>
                    <p>
                        C. <i>Spiritual power and authority</i>. To the church, Christ has entrusted the &#8220;keys
                        of the kingdom,&#8221; and to the church belongs the authority to &#8220;bind and
                        loose&#8221; on earth what has already been &#8220;bound and loosed&#8221; in heaven
                        (Matt. 16:19). This puts the decisions of the church on a vastly higher plane than
                        those of any other institution on earth! This is in keeping with the church&#8217;s
                        higher calling to make known &#8220;the manifold wisdom of God&#8221; to &#8220;the
                        rulers and authorities in the heavenly places&#8221; (Eph. 3:10).</p>
                    <p>
                        II. The Prerequisites of Church Membership</p>
                    <p>
                        The membership of Pilgrim Bible Church is open to anyone who possesses a living
                        and vital faith in Jesus Christ as Savior and Lord (Acts 20:21; 26:20), whose life
                        displays the faith-corroborating fruit of good works (Titus 3:4-8; James 2:14-17),
                        who has been water baptized by immersion since coming to faith in Christ, who subscribes
                        to the purpose and beliefs of Pilgrim Bible Church, and who desires to willingly
                        submit himself to the God-appointed leadership of the church (Heb. 13:17).</p>
                    <p>
                        III. The Process of Church Membership</p>
                    <p>
                        A. Any person who, after sitting under the teaching of the church for a sufficient
                        period of time, and, after serious and prayerful study of the Statement of Faith,
                        desires to become a member of the church, must submit a personal testimony in writing
                        to the elders, explaining his understanding of the gospel and of its impact upon
                        his life.</p>
                    <p>
                        B. If the applicant is, or has been, a member of another church, special effort
                        will be made to determine his standing in that church and his reason(s) for leaving.</p>
                    <p>
                        C. After the elders have prayerfully considered the written testimony, they shall
                        meet with the applicant to assess his or her qualifications for membership. If the
                        elders are satisfied that the applicant meets all of the scriptural criteria, the
                        church shall be notified of the applicant&#8217;s desire and called to prayer. Any
                        questions or concerns about the fitness of the applicant for membership should be
                        directed to the elders. If there are no valid objections, the applicant shall be
                        welcomed into full membership during any worship service designated by the elders
                        for that purpose.</p>
                    <p>
                        D. If, upon review of an applicant&#8217;s testimony, or after the interview by
                        the elders, it is determined the applicant has not confessed Jesus Christ as his
                        or her Lord and Savior, or that the applicant&#8217;s life is deficient in terms
                        of the fruit of repentance, membership shall be delayed until such time as the concern(s)
                        are no longer valid. A delay in the recognition of membership shall be considered
                        by the applicant as an exhortation to more serious self-assessment and to sober
                        reflection concerning his or her spiritual state, as well as an appeal to a deeper
                        repentance and holier walk of faith. Nevertheless, the criteria upon which membership
                        shall be determined will be <i>charitably applied</i> by the elders <i>in every case</i> in recognition
                        of the fact that the faith of even the weakest saint is still effective unto salvation
                        (Mark 9:24; Rom. 7:15-25; 1 Cor. 2:3; 2 Cor. 4:7ff.).</p>
                    <p align="center">
                        <strong>Article V: Church Officers</strong></p>
                    <p>
                        I. Elders and Deacons</p>
                    <p>
                        Scripture describes two kinds of church officers: elders and deacons (Phil. 1:1;
                        1 Tim. 3:1-13).</p>
                    <p>
                        A. Elders: Elders are to be men chosen for their biblical fitness for the office
                        based upon the scriptural qualifications outlined in 1 Timothy 3:1-7 and Titus 1:5-9.
                        The multiple interchangeable titles for this office (Acts 20:17, 28; Eph. 4:11-12;
                        Titus 1:5, 7) indicate the varied responsibilities of the elder. They include:</p>
                    <p>
                        1. Elder (<i>presbuteros</i>): literally, &#8220;aged&#8221; or &#8220;elderly&#8221;;
                        a term indicating possession of <i>wisdom</i> (normally associated with the elderly), and
                        the ability to render sage biblical counsel, so crucial in the leading of the church.
                        This term does <i>not</i> automatically exclude younger men from this office, as the example
                        of Timothy would indicate (1 Tim. 4:12). But younger men who are under consideration
                        must show good judgment in their own private business and family related concerns.
                        Though every elder possesses equal authority, not all will function in exactly the
                        same way (1 Tim. 5:17). Some will minister in the preaching and teaching capacity
                        based on their observable giftedness, while others will &#8220;rule&#8221; in an
                        administrative and spiritual oversight capacity. But those possessing a more public
                        ministry are in no way greater than other elders, as all the elders are to be mutually
                        under submission to one another and are subject to the same discipline as all the
                        members of the church.</p>
                    <p>
                        2. Shepherd (<i>poimaine</i>): This word indicates the responsibility of leading the flock
                        into the rich pasture of God&#8217;s Word, feeding the sheep of God&#8217;s flock
                        the truth of the gospel and of God&#8217;s great grace (John 21:15-17). The shepherd
                        must demonstrate skill in handling the Word of God accurately and a spiritual giftedness
                        in teaching others.</p>
                    <p>
                        3. Bishop, Overseer (<i>episkopos</i>): This responsibility has to do with the spiritual
                        protection of the flock in the midst of the world&#8217;s increasing deceptions
                        and spiritual dangers (Acts 20:29-31; 2 Tim. 4:1-5). Thus, elders need to be like
                        the men of Issachar of old who &#8220;understood the times, with knowledge of what
                        Israel should do&#8221; (1 Chron. 12:32). They should be men of great courage who
                        will not shrink back due to faintheartedness or fear of man in the need to exhort
                        the church to &#8220;examine everything carefully&#8221; and to &#8220;hold fast
                        to that which is good&#8221; (1 Thess. 5:21).</p>
                    <p>
                        B. Deacons: The Greek term translated &#8220;deacon&#8221; simply means &#8220;servant.&#8221;
                        Deacons&#8217; service may include responsibility for the ministry to the poor inside
                        and outside the church, physical maintenance of church properties, and oversight
                        of church finances. Their duties shall be discharged at the direction of as well
                        as in subjection to the elders. The qualifications for deacons are listed in 1 Timothy
                        3:8-13. Like elders, deacons are to be of high spiritual standing and unimpeachable
                        integrity. While only men may serve as elders, both spiritually qualified men and
                        women may serve as deacons.</p>
                    <p>
                        II. Their Number and Term of Office</p>
                    <p>
                        The New Testament does not designate a set number of elders or deacons, nor does
                        it specify a length of time for the performance of their duties. One truly called
                        to the office of elder or deacon is usually called to it for life. As these men
                        are clearly called God&#8217;s gifts to the flock (Eph. 4:11), the church should
                        seek such men <i>patiently</i> and <i>prayerfully</i> from God, maintaining great caution not
                        to &#8220;lay hands &#8230; too hastily&#8221; (1 Tim. 5:22) on a man who in reality may
                        not have the proper qualifications. Only when an elder or deacon excuses himself
                        for reasons he feels might temporarily hinder or even disqualify him for the office,
                        or when conduct unbecoming his high calling is discovered, may an elder or deacon
                        legitimately withdraw from office. Elders or deacons who have temporarily vacated
                        their post for providential reasons, not because of a disqualifying sin, may be
                        reinstated at the discretion of the elders, without being reexamined by the congregation.</p>
                    <p>
                        III. Their Appointment to Office</p>
                    <p>
                        The elders shall post a mutually-agreed upon list of candidates for elder and/or
                        deacon <i>four</i> Sundays before the meeting called for the purpose of the selection of
                        church officers. If this does not coincide with the time of the annual business
                        meeting, a special meeting will be called by the elders for this purpose. The congregation
                        shall confirm the fitness of the candidates chosen by the elders, or object to the
                        slate in a timely fashion by making their reservations known in writing to the elders
                        prior to the meeting. After a candidate has been selected, the elders shall lay
                        hands upon him in keeping with the biblical pattern for designation and committal
                        to office (1 Tim. 5:22).</p>
                    <p>
                        IV. Their Conduct of Office</p>
                    <p>
                        Elders and deacons shall strive for the unity of the Spirit in all matters of church
                        ministry as well as in the conduct of Pilgrim Bible Church&#8217;s business affairs.
                        The unanimous consent of the elders or deacons shall be required for the passage
                        or adoption of any item on their respective agendas.</p>
                    <p>
                        V. Review of Officers</p>
                    <p>
                        There shall be a periodic review of each elder&#8217;s and deacon&#8217;s performance
                        of his duties as long as he holds office. This review shall be conducted in the
                        same fashion as the officeholder&#8217;s selection, involving both peer review and
                        congregational input.</p>
                    <p>
                        VI. Duties of Congregation to their Leadership</p>
                    <p>
                        The congregation should submit joyfully and without reservations to the leadership
                        of the local church (Heb. 13:7, 17). Should such respectful submission become difficult
                        or impossible for any member of the church, he should seek a redress of his grievances
                        through a private interview with the leader(s) in question, taking special care
                        not to become the source of an unjustifiable accusation against an elder (or deacon).
                        The rule of conduct for such cases shall be Matthew 18:15-20.</p>

                    <p>
                        I. The Calling of Meetings</p>
                    <p>
                        A. Annual Business Meeting</p>
                    <p>
                        The elders will summon the congregation for the annual business meeting in January
                        or February to consider the church budget and other financial matters.</p>
                    <p>
                        B. Other Meetings</p>
                    <p>
                        In addition to the annual business meeting, the elders may call the church to order
                        to consider other matters of mutual concern throughout the year at their discretion.
                        These may include the recognition of officers, the admission of new members or the
                        administration of church discipline.</p>
                    <p>
                        II. The Conduct of Meetings</p>
                    <p>
                        A. The congregation must be notified of pending meetings one week in advance. This
                        time can be extended at the discretion of the elders in cases requiring more careful
                        congregational deliberation.</p>
                    <p>
                        B. The meetings of the church shall be confidential; members shall not communicate
                        church-related matters to non-members. However, non-members may be permitted to
                        attend church business meetings by permission of the elders.</p>
                    <p>
                        C. The agenda for each meeting shall be determined beforehand by the elders, and
                        under normal circumstances no other business shall be conducted at that particular
                        time. Members may approach the elders to suggest matters for formal discussion at
                        a future meeting.</p>
                    <p>
                        III. The Character of Meetings</p>
                    <p>
                        The church&#8217;s business is to be conducted in a gracious spirit characterized
                        by harmony and unity and by much prayer.</p>
                    <p align="center">
                        <strong>Article VII: Church Discipline</strong></p>
                    <p>
                        I. The Biblical Basis for Discipline</p>
                    <p>
                        The very clear instruction found in Matthew 18:15-20 outlines the procedure to be
                        followed in dealing with sin in the Body. God is serious about the holiness and
                        purity of the church, the Bride of His Son, Jesus Christ (Eph. 5:25-27), and the
                        calling of the individual believer in Christ is a calling unto holiness of heart
                        and life (Eph. 1:4; 4:17ff.; Titus 2:11-14). Sin, the great enemy of holiness and
                        purity, is the believer&#8217;s mortal enemy in his daily walk, and, if given a
                        foothold in the church, it can have a magnified and devastating impact upon the
                        entire congregation. Like a raging malignancy, sin can have far-reaching effects.
                        This explains the biblical language: &#8220;a little leaven leavens the whole lump
                        of dough&#8221; (1 Cor. 5:6; Gal. 5:9). Vigilant and sober self-government and discipline
                        are demanded if the Body is to carry out her mission and mandate to a lost and dying
                        world, whose temptations and treacheries have a deceptively subtle way of invading
                        the flock of God (Acts 20:28-31; Jude 12-13).</p>
                    <p>
                        II. The Forms of Discipline</p>
                    <p>
                        A. Formative Discipline</p>
                    <p>
                        This is the informal discipline of the church which is a function of biblical <i>koinonia</i>,
                        or &#8220;a sharing in common,&#8221; which is the heart of Christian fellowship.
                        Biblical fellowship involves watching over one another in love, advising, admonishing,
                        exhorting and praying for one another. It means lovingly warning a fellow believer
                        whose lifestyle may show signs of spiritual danger. It realizes that &#8220;open
                        rebuke&#8221; is better than &#8220;love that is concealed&#8221; (Prov. 27:5).
                        And if consistently applied in the life of the Body, formative discipline would
                        render less necessary the need for discipline of a more formal kind.</p>
                    <p>
                        B. Formal Discipline</p>
                    <p>
                        When formative discipline fails and members become disorderly in their conduct,
                        embrace destructive heresies, sin in a persistent though private manner, or sin
                        in such a way as to bring reproach upon the church and defame the name of Christ,
                        formal discipline is in order.</p>
                    <p>
                        III. The Purpose of Discipline</p>
                    <p>
                        A. Restoration</p>
                    <p>
                        First, the purpose of formal discipline is not to destroy but to &#8220;mend&#8221;
                        and &#8220;repair&#8221; someone who has fallen on the battlefield of life. (&#8220;Restore&#8221;
                        in Gal. 6:1 comes from a word meaning to mend torn fishing nets.)</p>
                    <p>
                        B. Equipping</p>
                    <p>
                        Second, restoration involves spiritually equipping the fallen saint with biblical
                        teaching and ongoing instruction so that further injury and damage may be avoided.</p>
                    <p>
                        C. Reclamation for ministry and service</p>
                    <p>
                        Third, restoration seeks to bring back a fallen saint to a condition of usefulness
                        in the kingdom of God. When applied in the proper biblical fashion, formal discipline
                        accomplishes several things:</p>
                    <p>
                        1. It removes and heals offenses in the church (1 Cor. 5:13; 2 Cor. 2:6-8);</p>
                    <p>
                        2. It reclaims a fallen saint to fellowship and service (Gal. 6:1);</p>
                    <p>
                        3. It serves as a deterrent to similar offenses (1 Tim. 5:20);</p>
                    <p>
                        4. It protects the entire church by purging the pollution of evil from her midst
                        (1 Cor. 5:6);</p>
                    <p>
                        5. It purifies the church and vindicates the cause and name of Christ (Ezek. 36:20-21;
                        Rom. 2:24).</p>
                    <p>
                        IV. The Proper Steps of Discipline</p>
                    <p>
                        Members of Pilgrim Bible Church and all other professing Christians who regularly
                        attend its services and who err in doctrine, or who engage in conduct that violates
                        Scripture as determined by the elders, shall be subject to formal discipline. In
                        Matthew 18:15-17, Jesus outlines four basic steps involved in the application of
                        formal church discipline. These are general guidelines, not a detailed blueprint.
                        While the basic guidelines must be followed, the church has the authority through
                        the grace and guidance of the Holy Spirit to apply the guidelines to individual
                        cases and situations (cf. Matt. 18:18-20).</p>
                    <p>
                        A. Step One: <i>Private Reproof</i></p>
                    <p>
                        Reproof is a Christian duty (Matt. 18:15). But it must be conducted in private,
                        between the offender and the one aware of the sin. If the sin is only suspected,
                        the confronting party need only explain what has been observed and ask for clarification.
                        Caring confrontation need not require a &#8220;smoking gun&#8221; in order to be
                        humbly and lovingly applied.</p>
                    <p>
                        B. Step Two: <i>Private Conference</i></p>
                    <p>
                        When the private rebuke goes unheeded, the wisdom of God has provided a second positive
                        step in the process of discipline: &#8220;But if he does not listen to you, take
                        one or two more with you, so that by the mouth of two or three witnesses every fact
                        may be confirmed&#8221; (Matt. 18:16). The involvement of several witnesses would
                        ensure that their testimony was truthful and without prejudice. These witnesses
                        need not have been actual observers of the alleged offense. The primary purpose
                        of the additional witnesses is <i>not</i> to provide eyewitness testimony, but to widen
                        the circle of accountability and to help the offender face the gravity of his sin.</p>
                    <p>
                        C. Step Three: <i>Public Announcement</i></p>
                    <p>
                        The third step in the process of discipline is revealed in Matthew 18:17: &#8220;And
                        if he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the church.&#8221; Up to this point
                        in the discipline process everything has occurred in private. But an unresponsive
                        offender requires stronger, <i>public</i> action. This third step actually contains two
                        parts. <i>First</i>, the witnesses are to bring their findings to the elders. <i>Then</i> the
                        elders are to convene the assembly of the saints to hear the charge(s), to pray
                        for the offender&#8217;s repentance and to marshal as many within the congregation
                        as the Spirit would lead in the next several days to approach the offender and urge
                        his repentance, with the elders themselves taking the lead in this process.</p>
                    <p>
                        D. Step Four: <i>Public Exclusion</i></p>
                    <p>
                        When the church leaders and members have made every effort to bring the sinner to
                        repentance without results, the Bible calls for them to disassociate the offender
                        from the church fellowship in accordance with the teaching of Matthew 18:17. The
                        unrepentant are cut off from church membership, fellowship and communion. The congregation
                        is to consider the offender as an unbeliever, refusing to have fellowship with him,
                        while at the same time continuing to pray for him and to reach out to him with the
                        gospel.</p>
                    <p>
                        If the offender is brought to repentance and comes before the congregation to publicly
                        convey his contrition and sorrow, he is to be restored as soon as possible. Any
                        delay in the restoration process may tragically deny the genuinely repentant the
                        forgiveness, comfort and reaffirmation of the congregation at a time when it is
                        most needed and subject the individual to &#8220;excessive sorrow&#8221; (2 Cor.
                        2:7). Such delay would also deny the congregation the celebration that a prodigal
                        son has returned, as though from the very dead! Here the Corinthian error is to
                        be avoided: hesitating to apply biblical discipline when needed and delaying restoration
                        long after it is called for (1 Cor. 5:1-13; 2 Cor. 2:7-8).</p>
                    <p>
                        In progressing through the stages of discipline, ample time for repentance and change
                        must be given at every step, the duration between the various stages contingent
                        upon the responsiveness of the offender and the discretion of the elders. In addition,
                        if the original offense is of such a nature as to warrant a more immediate and direct
                        response by the elders, then discipline may proceed less gradually, commencing with
                        the third step (the public announcement to the congregation of the sin(s)) or with
                        the fourth step (public exclusion) when one or more of the following has happened:</p>
                    <p>
                        (1) When the transgression has been of a decidedly public nature, bringing disgrace
                        to the name and cause of Christ (1 Cor. 5:1-5);</p>
                    <p>
                        (2) When a person has stubbornly refused to renounce any teaching deemed unbiblical
                        or false by the elders and has persisted in the teaching in spite of reproof (Rom.
                        16:17);</p>
                    <p>
                        (3) When the disciplined party persists in factious and divisive conduct after being
                        warned <i>twice</i> to cease from such behavior (Titus 3:10-11).</p>
                    <p>
                        V. The Proper Attitude in Discipline</p>
                    <p>
                        All members of Pilgrim Bible Church and all other professing Christians who regularly
                        attend the services of this church agree that in the event their own sins are deemed
                        by the leadership to be of so serious a nature as to warrant the imposition of formal
                        church discipline, they shall in no circumstances seek to pursue litigation against
                        the church in a public law court (1 Cor. 6:1-6), nor shall they withdraw from the
                        assembly before the process of discipline has run its course. Resignations from
                        membership are possible only by members in good standing who are <i>not</i> under any disciplinary
                        action.</p>
                    <p align="center">
                        <strong>Article VIII: Affiliation</strong></p>
                    <p>
                        We acknowledge no supreme ecclesiastical authority other than our Lord Jesus Christ,
                        who is the Head of His church (Eph. 5:23), and who directs the affairs of His church
                        through His Word and Spirit.</p>
                    <p>
                        We believe that local churches can best promote the cause of Jesus Christ by cooperating
                        with other like-minded churches (Acts 15:27-34; 1 Cor. 16:3; Gal. 1:2; Phil. 2:25;
                        Col. 4:7, 11, 16). We may seek the assistance and counsel of other churches in matters
                        of special concern to us, but Pilgrim Bible Church shall in no way be subject to
                        the authority, oversight or discipline of any other church, group of churches, fellowship
                        or association.</p>
                    <p>
                        Cooperation with other churches may be pursued through formal membership in a conference,
                        fellowship or association at the direction of the elders.</p>
                    <p align="center">
                        <strong>Article IX: Missions</strong></p>
                    <p>
                        In light of our Great Commission mandate to &#8220;make disciples of all the nations&#8221;
                        (Matt. 28:18-20), Pilgrim Bible Church shall actively seek to advance the kingdom
                        of our Lord Jesus Christ by sending missionaries to all corners of the globe with
                        the good news of the gospel.</p>
                    <p>
                        We will seek like-minded believers who have a very clear sense of calling to the
                        mission field, prayerfully present them to the congregation for approval and wholeheartedly
                        see to their maintenance through prayer, financial support and an ongoing ministry
                        of encouragement through regular communication.</p>
                    <p>
                        In order to see that the physical needs of our missionaries are being met, as well
                        as special needs which arise in the course of ministry in foreign lands, we may
                        join with other churches and/or sending agencies in a team approach to meeting those
                        needs.</p>
                    <p>
                        Our missions vision will not only embrace the unreached of foreign lands, but it
                        will likewise target domestic efforts to evangelize the lost for which we are burdened
                        by the Lord of the harvest.</p>
