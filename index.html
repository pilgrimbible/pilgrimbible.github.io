<center><p><small><i>Welcome Message from<br>Pastor Bryan Pollock</i></small></p></center>
<p>If you&rsquo;re looking for a church home where the biblical gospel is clearly,
and, we trust, compellingly proclaimed, then visit us next Sunday at Pilgrim Bible Church.</p>
<p>In our post-modern world where doctrine is roundly disparaged as
either divisive or irrelevant to one&rsquo;s faith, we believe that doctrine is vital to faith.
Indeed, we believe with John Piper that &ldquo;true doctrine is the foundation of
true delight,&rdquo; delight in God and in His great salvation through Jesus Christ!</p>
<p>We make no apologies for the doctrines of grace, we believe them
with conviction and live them with passion. And the great God of our salvation, by
grace alone, through faith alone, because of Christ alone, is the supreme object of our
worship and the fountain of our joy each Sunday as we gather to worship Him &ldquo;in
spirit and truth&rdquo; (John 4:24).</p>
<p>Please join us as together we seek to proclaim 
&ldquo;the excellencies of Him who has called you out of darkness into
His marvelous light&rdquo; (1&nbsp;Pet. 2:9).</p>
<br>--></p>
